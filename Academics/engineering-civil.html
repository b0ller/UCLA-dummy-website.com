    <p class="para">
      Civil engineering is a branch of engineering that deals with the planning,
      design, construction, operation, and maintenance of infrastructure
      projects and systems. The primary focus of civil engineering is on
      projects that benefit society, such as transportation systems, water
      supply, waste management, environmental protection, and structural and
      geotechnical engineering. Civil engineers are responsible for ensuring the
      safety, functionality, and sustainability of the built environment.
